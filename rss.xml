And across the straits, Morocco alive with spice akin to the orient but just as at home with grilled sardines and almond cookies as their Iberian neighbours. The breeze from the Atlantic ever omnipresent in Al-Maghreb]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[and then a whole new chapter began... i began to look at our culinary influences less as British or English with a healthy interest in ‘ethnic’ colonial touch, nor that as most Italians if not mediterraneans would have you believe, that their food is superior to everyone else’s, nor giving in to the outdated notion that the French know best, nor that the Scandinavians are rightly the new doyenne of the world kitchen despite having some of the most avant-garde kitchens today.
