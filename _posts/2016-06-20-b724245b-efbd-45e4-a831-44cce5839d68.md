title: >-
  and then a whole new chapter began... i began to look at our culinary
  influences less as British or English with a healthy interest in ‘ethnic’
  colonial touch, nor that as most Italians if not mediterraneans would have you
  believe, that their food is superior to everyone else’s, nor giving in to the
  outdated notion that the French know best, nor that the Scandinavians are
  rightly the new doyenne of the world kitchen despite having some of the most
  avant-garde kitchens today.


  No, it’s all and none of these things - it is less about Northern Europe v
  Southern Europe, and more about an Atlantic kitchen which by the nature of our
  coastal and island nature lead us to being traders. Our kitchen contains great
  produce - look to the wonderful larder in Norway and Scotland a bounty of some
  of the best fish, the beef and other livestock and their dairy products
  amazing - think Icelandic Skyr, Devon Clotted Cream, the king of cheese -
  Cheddar, the milk and cheeses from Asturias and Cantabria... i could go on and
  on...
