# MENUS

**We are a fresh innovative catering company based in Brussels.**

**Click on a link to download our menus - the seasonal menus start with breakfast and coffee breaks, through to hot and cold buffets, our business lunch delivery options on to canapes and walking dinners.**

We pride ourselves on offering REAL FOOD with good nutrition to boot. We are trying to reduce the sugar and refined flour where we can without sacrificing on taste. We not only cater to most allergies but we are mainstreaming many gluten and grain-free wholefoods so that you can offer your guests informed choices and options. In terms of style, we are not only offer a British menu, but rather a modern interpretation of an international Atlantic style - with plenty from the Nordic and Baltic Kitchen, through the North Sea, Britain and Ireland, France and the Iberian Peninsula, with touches from our American and Latin cousins on the other side, and a few eclectic dishes from our travels afar.

A RENEWAL menu for Winter and Early Spring - comforting and cleansing, simple tastes and a touch of spice
