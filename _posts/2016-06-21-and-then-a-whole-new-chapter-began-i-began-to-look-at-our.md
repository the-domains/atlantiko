and then a whole new chapter began... i began to look at our culinary influences less as British or English with a healthy interest in 'ethnic' colonial touch, nor that as most Italians if not mediterraneans would have you believe, that their food is superior to everyone else's, nor giving in to the outdated notion that the French know best, nor that the Scandinavians are rightly the new doyenne of the world kitchen despite having some of the most avant-garde kitchens today.

No, it's all and none of these things - it is less about Northern Europe v Southern Europe, and more about an Atlantic kitchen which by the nature of our coastal and island nature lead us to being traders. Our kitchen contains great produce - look to the wonderful larder in Norway and Scotland a bounty of some of the best fish, the beef and other livestock and their dairy products amazing - think Icelandic Skyr, Devon Clotted Cream, the king of cheese - Cheddar, the milk and cheeses from Asturias and Cantabria... i could go on and on...

Think about the wonderful hams from the piggies free roaming around the deheasas of Extremedura and Western Andalucia, and all of the wonderful produce like the kale and root vegetables as well as delightful peaches, apples and pears... we are blessed with some of the best food available in Europe and the wider world.

And across the straits, Morocco alive with spice akin to the orient but just as at home with grilled sardines and almond cookies as their Iberian neighbours. The breeze from the Atlantic ever omnipresent in Al-Maghreb

Our trading nature brought us via Spain and Portgual much of the new world larder - Vikings and Basque fisherman that found the great cod banks of Newfoundland and 'discovered' Greenland, think of all that great cold water fish - heavenly prawns, artic king crab, huge cod - fresh simple and undeniably delicious.

Later we went to India, around the Cape, to the Caribbean and further afield. We traded and got a taste for all those spices both in the simple christmas baking range and then more boldy with all the curries and chilies that we eat nowadays as if they were as simple and essential as salt in our food...

Welcome to our world - the cuisine based on local produce wherever we are, touched and influenced by our global Atlantic heritage, a curious gourmet traveller's repetoire of freshness
