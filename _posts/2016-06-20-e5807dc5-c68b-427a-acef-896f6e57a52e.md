  We pride ourselves on offering REAL FOOD with good nutrition to boot. We are
  trying to reduce the sugar and refined flour where we can without sacrificing
  on taste. We not only cater to most allergies but we are mainstreaming many
  gluten and grain-free wholefoods so that you can offer your guests informed
  choices and options. In terms of style, we are not only offer a British menu,
  but rather a modern interpretation of an international Atlantic style - with
  plenty from the Nordic and Baltic Kitchen, through the North Sea, Britain and
  Ireland, France and the Iberian Peninsula, with touches from our American and
  Latin cousins on the other side, and a few eclectic dishes from our travels
  afar.
